### Note: PDF reframing
In this first version, the application only manages PDF with one graph, as shown in the directory samples.

If you need to "reframe" your graphs, you can use **[gpdfx](https://github.com/lehner/gpdfx)** (UNIX environment required).

_Note 1: don't forget to add the executable **clipdfx** to your PATH variable environment._

_Note 2: You may need to install some dependencies before launching gpdfx :_
> `sudo apt-get install python-poppler python texlive-extra-utils texlive`
